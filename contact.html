	<p>Hello, I am Manideep, a senior (final year) undergraduate student from <a href="https://iitg.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati</a> 
	with major in Electronics and Communication Engineering but my major interest has been in the field of Deep Learning and
	Artificial Intelligence during my undergraduate studies. I'm documenting my learning notes and sharing my views in this blog. Send me an email: manideepkolla AT iitg.ac.in if you have questions or find errors. Thanks :)</p>
